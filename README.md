Buzz Fizz
=========

Write a program that prints to the console the numbers from 1 to 100.

But for multiples of **three** print **"Buzz"** instead of the number and for the multiples of **five** print **"Fizz"**.

For numbers which are multiples of **three** and **five** print **"BuzzFizz"**.

You have 1 hour to write the program. We prefer that you fork the GitHub repository to a public location and check-in all code to this repository.

Alternatively, you can email your solution to: geoff@recruitmentgenius.com

Notes
-----

The project has been set-up with a test project and NUnit and Shouldly (to allow fluent assertions). You are free to replace NUnit with your chosen testing framework should you so desire.

The tests can be run using NUnit test runner, or a test runner in something like ReSharper.
